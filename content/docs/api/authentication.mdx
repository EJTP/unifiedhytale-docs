description: How to authenticate with the UnifiedHytale API.
---

Most API endpoints require authentication. UnifiedHytale uses API keys for server-to-server communication.

## Getting an API Key

1. Log in to [unifiedhytale.com](https://unifiedhytale.com)
2. Go to Settings → Developer
3. Click "Generate API Key"
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Callout type="warn">
Keep your API key secret! Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.unifiedhytale.com/v1/projects
```

Or in code:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.unifiedhytale.com/v1/projects', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

## Public Endpoints

Some endpoints don't require authentication:

- `GET /projects` - List public projects
- `GET /projects/:slug` - Get public project details
- `GET /servers` - List public servers

## Scopes

API keys can have different permission scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:projects` | Read project data |
| `write:projects` | Create/update projects |
| `read:users` | Read user profiles |
| `read:servers` | Read server listings |
| `verify:licenses` | Verify license keys |

## Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to Settings → Developer
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click "Revoke"

Revoked keys immediately stop working.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode API keys
2. **Rotate regularly** - Generate new keys periodically
3. **Minimal scopes** - Only request permissions you need
4. **Monitor usage** - Check your API usage logs regularly
