## Authentication

### API Tokens

All API requests require authentication using an API token. You can create and manage API tokens from your [dashboard](https://unifiedhytale.com/dashboard).

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit API tokens to version control
- Store tokens securely in environment variables
- Rotate tokens regularly and revoke unused ones
- Use different tokens for different environments (dev, prod)

## Base URL
