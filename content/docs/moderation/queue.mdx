description: Understanding how content moderation works on UnifiedHytale.
---

All uploads on UnifiedHytale go through a moderation process to ensure community safety.

## How It Works

When you submit a project or update, it enters the moderation queue:

1. **Submission** - Project enters the queue
2. **Automated Checks** - Virus scanning and validation
3. **Manual Review** - Staff reviews content
4. **Decision** - Approved or feedback sent

## Review Timeline

| Priority | Typical Time |
|----------|--------------|
| New versions | 12-24 hours |
| New projects | 24-48 hours |
| Verified creators | 6-12 hours |
